# assigment-3-unsupervised-learning-dimensionality-reduction

The main code is broken up into two files. The datasets have been provided for both the chess game and credit risk dimensionality reduction evaluations. Each dataset has its own class(chess_game.py and credit_risk.py) for running each of the experiments. To run the code properly you will need to download each dataset and provide a path in both of the python classes to your chosen dataset location.
